How to Execute ExtendScript in Premiere Pro
===========================================

Executing scripts from within CEP panels is the recommended approach. It is also possible to invoke scripts from within ESTK, but that's not a user-friendly approach for most workflows. Also, with additional configuration work, it's possible to pass scripts to Premiere Pro on a command line. This is not recommended, as behavior varies across platforms, and preliminary configuration is necessary before such execution is enabled.

Stick with panels whenever possible.
